\section{Background}
What is random matrix theory?\hfill\break
Random Matrix Theory is a combination of statistics and traditional matrix theory. In this field, many tools from statitistics are used to describe matrices with random elements instead of relying on those individual elements. It allows us to generalize about certain characteristics of mtrices with similar statistical properties. Many problems in physical systems modeling and biological systems modeling involve matrices with random entries. \hfill\break
Random Matrix Theory in Ecology\hfill\break
-what is it useful for?\hfill\break
Traditionally in one-dimensional models of population growth, specifically lotka volterra there are birth rates $r_b$, death rates $r_d$, and a carrying capacity, K.  \hfill\break
\hfill\break Model \hfill\break \hfill\break
Although, if we want to include the effects of other species on a single species, in ecological models of population growth across species we often include something called an interaction matrix. It describes the way that different species interact with each other and effect eachothers survivial whether it be positively, negatively or with no effect at all. This is an essential aspect of a species environment which plays a large role in its survival. The simplest model of populations size of the ith species in an ecosystem is given by,\hfill\break
\hfill\break 
$y_i(t+1)=y(t) + \Delta t(A_ij\times y_i +\xi_i)$
\hfill\break
where $y_i(t)$ is the population of species i at time t, $\xi_i$ is random noise that might affect a species growth, and $A_ij$ is the matrix that describes the interactions between the species.

An example interaction matrix is illustrated in Figure (blah)(notes from Andy & page 166 ).\hfill\break 
\hfill\break figure \hfill\break \hfill\break
Here we have a small ecosystem of just 2 species for simplicity. In this case the model for population size of species i can be expanded to, 
\hfill\break
\hfill\break
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{cases}
%\dfrac{dT}{dt}=-\beta V T\\\\
%\dfrac{dI_1}{dt}=\beta V T- kI_1\\\\
%\end{cases}
%\end{equation}
